# CS-350-Rasberry-Pi-Project

I built a smart thermostat system using a Raspberry Pi and different hardware components. I started by setting up the Raspberry Pi and learning how to control LEDs using GPIO pins. Then I added buttons and created a simple state machine to control heating and cooling modes. As the project grew, I connected a 16x2 display screen to show information and later added a temperature and humidity sensor using I2C communication. I programmed the system to read real temperature data, display it in Fahrenheit or Celsius, and show humidity as a percentage. I also added button controls to switch temperature scales and adjust settings.

Throughout the project, I practiced planning, coding, debugging, and testing. I learned how to read datasheets, use official documentation, and troubleshoot hardware and software issues step by step. I improved my understanding of embedded systems, hardware architecture, and how system design affects performance. I focused on writing clean, organized code with comments so it would be easy to read and update later. By the end of the seven weeks, I created a working prototype that demonstrates how software can control hardware in a real-world system.
